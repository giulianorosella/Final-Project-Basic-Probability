The folder contains two files:

- "LinearRegressing" is the code we implemented

- "Report" is the pdf of the report of our project.

In order to run "LinearRegressing" you have to use an interpreter that can import from the packages scikit-learn,
matplotlib and numpy. In order to be able to use these packages, one needs Anaconda or something similar installed
on his computer.
